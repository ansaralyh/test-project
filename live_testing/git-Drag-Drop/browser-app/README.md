# GitHub Helper Web

A React-based web application for interacting with GitHub repositories.

## Overview of the Application

This application is a GitHub helper web interface built with React. It allows users to authenticate with GitHub, browse their repositories, navigate through repository contents, and upload files to repositories. The application is structured using modern React practices, including functional components, hooks for state management, and styled-components for styling.

## Features

- GitHub authentication using OAuth tokens
- Repository listing and selection
- File and directory navigation
- File content viewing
- **Large file upload support** with chunked processing and progress tracking
- **ZIP file upload and automatic extraction**
- **Background processing** to prevent UI freezing
- **Real-time progress indicators** with estimated time remaining
- **Configurable upload settings** (batch size, delays, retries)
- **Intelligent conflict resolution** for file uploads
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff for failed operations
- File upload functionality with drag and drop support
- Branch selection and navigation
- Notification system for user feedback

## File Structure and Relationships

The application consists of several key files and directories:

1. `index.js` - The entry point of the React application
2. `App.js` - The main application component containing all the business logic
3. `styles/StyledComponents.js` - A collection of styled components used for UI rendering
4. `components/` - Reusable UI components
   - `UploadProgress.js` - Progress tracking component for large uploads
   - `UploadSettings.js` - Configurable upload settings component
   - `ConsolidateButton.js` - Repository consolidation button
   - `ConsolidateModal.js` - Repository consolidation modal
5. `utils/` - Utility functions
   - `UploadUtils.js` - Large file upload utilities with chunking and retry logic
   - `ConsolidationUtils.js` - Repository consolidation utilities

### index.js

The index.js file serves as the entry point for the React application. It imports React and ReactDOM, as well as the main App component and a CSS file. It uses ReactDOM.createRoot to render the App component inside a React.StrictMode wrapper, which helps identify potential problems in the application during development.

### App.js

App.js contains the main application component and all the business logic. It's a functional component that uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management. The component imports a large number of styled components from the StyledComponents.js file, which are used to build the UI.

Key features of the App component include:

- GitHub authentication using OAuth tokens
- Repository listing and selection
- File and directory navigation
- File content viewing
- File upload functionality with drag and drop support
- Branch selection and navigation
- Notification system for user feedback

The component maintains several state variables to track the application state, including authentication status, user information, repository data, file contents, and UI state for modals and notifications.

### StyledComponents.js

This file contains all the styled components used in the application, created using the styled-components library. The components are organized by their function in the application:

- Layout components (AppContainer, MainContent, Content)
- Header components (Header, Title, UserInfo)
- Button components (LoginButton, LogoutButton, etc.)
- Sidebar components (Sidebar, SidebarHeader, RepoList)
- Repository components (RepositoryHeader, RepoName, BranchSelector)
- Navigation components (PathNavigator, PathItem)
- File explorer components (FileExplorer, FileItem)
- Drag and drop components (DropZone)
- Modal components for file uploads and previews
- Notification components

Each styled component is exported individually, allowing them to be imported and used in the App component.

## Component Relationships

The relationship between these files follows a clear separation of concerns:

1. `index.js` handles the application initialization and mounting
2. `App.js` contains all the business logic and state management
3. `StyledComponents.js` provides the UI components with consistent styling

The App component imports and uses the styled components to create the user interface, while the business logic within App.js controls the behavior of these components. This separation allows for easier maintenance and updates to either the UI or the business logic without affecting the other.

The application follows a component-based architecture typical of React applications, with a clear hierarchy of components. The main App component serves as the container for all other components, managing the application state and passing data down to child components through props (in this case, through the styled components' props).

## Styling Approach

The application uses styled-components, a CSS-in-JS library that allows for component-level styling with the full power of JavaScript. This approach offers several advantages:

1. Scoped styles that don't leak to other components
2. Dynamic styling based on props (as seen in the RepoItem component that changes background color when selected)
3. Theme consistency through the application
4. Elimination of class name conflicts

The styled components in this application follow GitHub's dark theme, with colors like #0d1117 for backgrounds and #c9d1d9 for text, creating a cohesive and professional look.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- A GitHub account
- A GitHub OAuth token for authentication

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Log in with your GitHub token
2. Select a repository from the sidebar
3. Navigate through directories and view files
4. Upload files by dragging and dropping them into the designated area

### Large File Upload Features

- **ZIP Files**: Drag and drop ZIP files to automatically extract and upload all contents
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar with estimated time remaining
- **Batch Processing**: Files are processed in configurable batches to prevent timeouts
- **Settings**: Adjust batch size, delays, and retry attempts in the upload settings
- **Conflict Resolution**: Choose to replace or skip conflicting files
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting with retry capabilities
- **Cancellation**: Cancel uploads at any time during processing

### Upload Settings

- **Batch Size**: Number of files processed simultaneously (default: 10)
- **Delay Between Batches**: Pause between batches to avoid rate limits (default: 1000ms)
- **Max Retries**: Number of retry attempts for failed operations (default: 3)
- **Max File Size**: Maximum individual file size limit (default: 100MB)
